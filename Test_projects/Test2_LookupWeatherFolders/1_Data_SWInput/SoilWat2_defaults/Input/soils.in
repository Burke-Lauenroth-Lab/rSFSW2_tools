# Soil layer definitions
# Location:
#
# depth = (cm) lower limit of layer; layers must be in order of depth.
# matricd = (g/cm^3) bulk density of soil in this layer.
# gravel_content = the percent volume of each layer composed of gravel (i.e., particles > 2mm)
# evco = (frac) proportion of total baresoil evap from this layer.
# trco = (frac) proportion of total transpiration from this layer for each vegetation type (tree, forb, shrub, grass)
# %sand = (frac) proportion of sand in layer (0-1.0).
# %clay = (frac) proportion of clay in layer (0-1.0).
# imperm = (frac) proportion of 'impermeability' to water percolation(/infiltration/drainage) in layer (0-1.0)
# soiltemp = the initial temperature of each soil layer (in Celsius), from the day before the simulation starts
# Note that the evco and trco columns must sum to 1.0 or they will
# be normalized.
